            Hi there. We tried to test the file that you submitted. Unfortunately, it didn't work as expected.
            We are unable process your input, as the uploaded file is not a valid JS file. Please create another
            submission with your JS file. Once you upload the file, we'll test the file to check if it returns
            the correct output

            Give it another go!
